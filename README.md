# Python-Examples

# Sales Model

This project is from my internship as a Data Scientist. The goal of the project is to predict the amount of time it will take for the sales department to complete a quote. The light gradient boosted model uses Salesforce data that I pulled using SOQL Workbench queries. 
The project is in 'Sales.ipynb'.

# Predicted-Value

This project is from my internship as a Data Scientist. This project is part of a larger project to predict the value of a customer. I used a light gradient boosted model to predict if a customer is going to increase insurance coverage. The data was pulled from several sources within the organization.
The project is in 'Predict-Value-ipynb'.

# Large Language Model

This project is from my internship as a Data Scientist. I created a large language model that would be used to ingest certain data for the given department's goals. The model is deployed as an AWS endpoint in SageMaker that a Software Engineer Intern used an API to reach. 
The model is in 'LLM.ipynb'.
